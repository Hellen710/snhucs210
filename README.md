these are projects completed during CS 210 at SNHU as an online student. here are the questions I am directed to answer. 

im using the banking application project. 

    -Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
   Answer: a banking application. could tell you amount saved, amount invested, interest gained, etc. on a yearly scale. 
    
    -What did you do particularly well?
   Answer: I believe that I did not do anything "particularly well". for I Struggled immenesly. 
    
    -Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  Answer: I assume my code could be enhanced in multiple places. I am still learning. This is an odd question, I cant answer specifically what improvements could make my code more efficent etc., because if i knew about them i would of used them in my project. 
    
    -Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? Answer: Honestly C plus plus is very confusing and i found majority of it to be difficult. I attempted to seek guidance from my professor with not much luck, then turned to github, stackoverflow, chegg, and youtube for help. I guess a few of the websites i just listed can be considered resources or tools, but i am unaware of what a support network is. 
    
    -What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    Answer: I honestly did not absorb any skills, therefore nothing will be trasnferrable to other projects or coursework. 
    
    -How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Answer: by reaserching the project on the internet.
